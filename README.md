# Car-Client-Record-System
Car Client Record System is a log system that records the purchase details of a Chevrolet car tailor-made to fit the clients style and needs. It also provides the administration a glimpse at all the records of their clientele.

Built using an interactive menu driven C++ program, our project is founded on the essential principles of OOP: classes, objects, inheritance, data abstraction and encapsulation, polymorphism.

The program begins with the main–client/admin–panel menu.
The client panel will direct the client to customizing their car with accessories and amenities. They will be prompted to enter their personal details- name, contact number, email-and vehicle number details. The final display includes a glance at the custom-made car features along with client information and payment details.
The admin panel will prompt the user for the password and upon matching, it will load to the admin menu that will allow access to the client records. Logging off will direct him to the main panel menu.
