# Welcome to Chevrolet Client Record System

A *simple log system* that records the purchase details of a Chevrolet car tailored to the style and comfort of our clients. It also provides the administration a glimpse at all the records of their clientele.


Built using an interactive menu driven C++ program, our project is founded on the essential principles of OOP: classes, objects, inheritance, data abstraction and encapsulation, polymorphism.
